            ichel de Montaigne, in full Michel Eyquem de Montaigne, 
            (born February 28, 1533, Château de Montaigne,
             near Bordeaux, France—died September 23, 1592, 
             Château de Montaigne), French writer whose Essais 
             (Essays) established a new literary form.
              In his Essays he wrote one of the most captivating 
              and intimate self-portraits ever given, on a par with 
              Augustine’s and Rousseau’s.
